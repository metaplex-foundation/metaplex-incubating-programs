# mpl-fireball

This package contains the fireball contract SDK code.

## Developing

In order to update the generated SDK when the rust contract was updated please run:

```
yarn gen:api
```

NOTE: at this point this only generates the IDL json file but later will generate TypeScript
definitions and SDK code as well, derived from that IDL.
